* Title comments are separated by `#---` with 79 `-`. 
* Respect 80 symbols margin for each line
* The name of the sections should be verbs
* I have shorten the variable names and change names for the classes (e.g.,
  COVID- is healthy, and not only without COVID)
* Only smaller case and no special symbols for folder names and classes
* In R typically `for` loop is not really appriciated; instead use `*apply`
  family
* It is better to stick to `tidyverse` function everywhere, e.g., `read_csv()`
  should be used instead of `read.csv()`
* Please do not copy comments 
* Line 88: `jpeg2` is not the best name (it could be a name of a function)
* "X-ray" should be written with capital X in all corpus and comments
